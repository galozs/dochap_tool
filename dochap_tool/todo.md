#Changes todo
----
##Data changes
- ncbi refseq from ucsc
- take accession from protein.genbank
----
##Domains:
- relative to genomic positions
- for each domain and transcript find defects (every missmatch)
- Draw by relative position on a different line
----
##gtf
- check for fkpm and rpkm, and sort by it
- allow to compare two gtfs with the database (low priority)
----
##Transcripts
- Reduce height of exons, keep height diff between transcripts
- Fix exons before cds start not shown at different height
- Less arrows, reduce size
- Change to triangle, color filled
- Change line color to black
- Change triangle color to grey
- Add grid-lines instead of ticks, make them light grey and low opacity
- Add to the start line chrnumber:
- Add number to tick at middle of line
- Change transcript id info to 'known transcript id:{id}' and 'new transcript id:{id}'
----
## Utilities
- Add range search for all transcripts (locus) (gtf data only)
- List of all *new* transcripts ordered by gene symbol
----
## Add about information
- Technical stuff (me)
- Biology and why (Shani)
